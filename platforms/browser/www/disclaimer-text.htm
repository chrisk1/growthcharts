			<b>Growth Charts UK-WHO is the first mobile app to use UK-specific growth chart data to help health professionals to calculate growth centiles for babies and children.</b><br><br>Growth centile calculations are often prone to error with paper charts, and this app aims to make this process quicker and more reliable.<br><br>

			Data used in this app has been provided by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), and is a combination of the Neonatal and Infant Close Monitoring Growth Chart (NICM), the UK WHO 0-4 years growth chart, and the UK Growth chart (2-18).<br><br>

			The underlying data is from a combination of the following sources:<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>British 1990</b> growth reference for height and weight. Published in 1995 and revised in 1996. The reference for head circumference was published in 1998.<br>
				<ul><li>Freeman JV, Cole TJ, Chinn S, Jones PRM, White E M, Preece MA. <i>Cross sectional stature and weight reference curves for the UK, 1990.</i> Archives of Disease in Childhood 1995;73:17-24.</li>
				<li>Cole TJ, Freeman JV, Preece MA. <i>British 1990 growth reference centiles for weight, height, body mass index and head circumference fitted by maximum penalized likelihood. </i>Statistics in Medicine 1998;17:407-429.<br><br></li></ul></li>

				<li><b>UK-WHO Child Growth Standards</b><br>
				Data for the 2 weeks to 6 months corrected age and 6 months to 2 years corrected age charts. These charts are derived from the UK-WHO 0-4 years growth charts and use World Health Organization (WHO) data on healthy, non-deprived breastfed children of mothers who did not smoke.

				<li><b>Methodology</b><br>
				This app uses methodology from the US CDC: "Percentile Data Files with LMS Values, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", full information at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/percentile_data_files.htm" class="external">the CDC website</a>.<br><br></li>

				<li><b>Testing and quality assurance</b><br>
				This app has been rigorously tested against the RCPCH Growth Charts.
